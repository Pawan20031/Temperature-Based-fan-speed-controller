The temperature-based fan speed controller project utilizing TinyML (Tiny Machine Learning) on Arduino is an innovative application that combines embedded systems and machine learning capabilities for efficient thermal management. This project employs a small, low-power microcontroller like Arduino, enhanced with TinyML, which enables on-device machine learning inference. The system is designed to monitor ambient temperature using a temperature sensor and dynamically adjust the speed of a fan accordingly. The TinyML model, trained to recognize temperature patterns, runs directly on the Arduino board, eliminating the need for a constant connection to external servers. This enhances responsiveness, reduces latency, and optimizes energy consumption
